# Zig-sfml3

Example project of using [SFML3](https://www.sfml-dev.org) with Zig 0.14.0 via [CSFML](https://github.com/SFML/csfml)

All of the code is from my blog post [here](https://aarol.dev/posts/zig-0.14-sfml/)

On Linux, it needs the `CSFML` (package `csfml`, `libcsfml-dev` or similar)

On Windows, it needs `SFML` and `CSFML` releases extracted to the project root (outlined [here](https://aarol.dev/posts/zig-0.14-sfml/))

## Running

`zig build run` or `zig build --release=fast run`
